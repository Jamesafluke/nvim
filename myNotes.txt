Some Lua Notes:
config = functino() block is a Lua function used in Neovim's plugin configuration,
particlarly when managing plugins with a plugin manager.
It defines a setup function that runs after the plugin is loaded, allowing you to configure behavior
- Set up key mappings.
- plugin-specific options
- Initialization for the plu5gin to work properly


require("someplugin")
    Loades the module named someplugin
    typically, someplugin corresponds to the name of the plugin or its Lua entry point

Plugin managers like Lazy support an opts field, which automatically passes the options to a plugin's setup() function if the plugin exporer one.
    This eliminates the need for a confog block when the config is straghtforward.
    The plugin manager detects the opts field ant automatically calls
        require("toggleterm").setup(opts)

Typically, config = function() is only needed for custom logic or complex stuff including custom commands, set keymaps, or talk to other plugins.

Best practices:
    Use opts when possible.(Which I should because Lazy supports it.)
    If the plugin's setup can be handled with a single setup() call, prefer opts for simplicity..
Use config (fonfig = function()) for logic, keybindings, or talking to other plugins.

Some plugins require setup() to be called in a config block, while other work fine with opts. See plugin's docs.
