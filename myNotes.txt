Dumb case sensitive.



So it looks like you can either:
	Have a plugins directory with a whole bunch of individual files for each plugin.
	Have a plugins directory with a single file (mine is called /plugins/init.lua) and list all the plugins in a table.
From there, you have to require it from /nvim/init.lua. It also looks like there's configuration or setup junk that you can mess with.
