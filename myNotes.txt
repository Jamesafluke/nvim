DONE Terminal!
DONE Relative line numbers

Tabs!

P - paste before cursor
p - paste after cursor

d - delete text
c - delete text and insert mode

Selection Registers
For copy pasting!
Vim has two selection registers: quotestar "* and quoteplus "+
So you can enter Visual, select something, "*y


OR I THINK THIS IS BETTER
set clipboard=unnamed
lets you use the unnamed clipboard (p) to paste. Try this next.


So it looks like you can either:
	Have a plugins directory with a whole bunch of individual files for each plugin.
	Have a plugins directory with a single file (mine is called /plugins/init.lua) and list all the plugins in a table.
From there, you have to require it from /nvim/init.lua. It also looks like there's configuration or setup junk that you can mess with.

config = function()
	stuff goes here
	end
